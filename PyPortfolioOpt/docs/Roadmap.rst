Roadmap
=======

These are some of the things that I am thinking of adding in the near future. If you
have any other feature requests, please raise them using GitHub
`issues <https://github.com/robertmartin8/PyPortfolioOpt/issues>`_

- Optimising for higher moments (i.e skew and kurtosis)
- Factor modelling: doable but not sure if it fits within the API.
- Proper CVaR optimisation – remove NoisyOpt and use proper linear programming
- Monte Carlo optimisation with custom distributions
- Open-source backtests using either `Backtrader <https://www.backtrader.com/>`_ or
  `Zipline <https://github.com/quantopian/zipline>`_.
- Further support for different risk/return models


0.5.0
=====

- Black-Litterman model and docs.
- Custom bounds per asset
- Improved ``BaseOptimizer``, adding a method that writes weights
  to text and fixing a bug in ``set_weights``.
- Unconstrained quadratic utility optimisation (analytic)
- Revamped docs, with information on types of attributes and
  more examples.

0.5.1
-----

Fixed an error with dot products by amending the pandas requirements.

0.5.2
-----

Made PuLP, sklearn, noisyopt optional dependencies to improve installation
experience.

0.5.3
-----

- Fixed an optimisation bug in `EfficientFrontier.efficient_risk`. An error is now
thrown if optimisation fails.
- Added a hidden API to change the scipy optimiser method. 

0.4.0
=====

- Major improvements to ``discrete_allocation``. Added functionality to allocate shorts;
  modified the linear programming method suggested by `Dingyuan Wang <https://github.com/gumblex>`_;
  added postprocessing section to User Guide.
- Further refactoring and docs for ``HRPOpt``.
- Major documentation update, e.g to support custom optimisers

0.4.1
-----

- Added CLA back in after getting permission from Dr Marcos López de Prado
- Added more tests for different risk models.

0.4.2
-----

- Minor fix for ``clean_weights``
- Removed official support for python 3.4.
- Minor improvement to semicovariance, thanks to `Felipe Schneider <https://github.com/schneiderfelipe>`_.

0.4.3
-----

- Added ``prices_from_returns`` utility function and provided better docs for ``returns_from_prices``.
- Added ``cov_to_corr`` method to produce correlation matrices from covariance matrices.
- Fixed readme examples.



0.3.0
=====

- Merged an amazing PR from `Dingyuan Wang <https://github.com/gumblex>`_ that rearchitects
  the project to make it more self-consistent and extensible.
- New algorithm: ML de Prado's CLA
- New algorithms for converting continuous allocation to discrete (using linear
  programming).
- Merged a `PR <https://github.com/robertmartin8/PyPortfolioOpt/pull/22>`__ implementing Single Factor and
  Constant Correlation shrinkage.

0.3.1
-----

Merged `PR <https://github.com/robertmartin8/PyPortfolioOpt/pull/23>`__ from `TommyBark <https://github.com/TommyBark>`_ 
fixing a bug in the arguments of a call to ``portfolio_performance``.

0.3.3
-----

Migrated the project internally to use the ``poetry`` dependency manager. Will still keep ``setup.py`` and ``requirements.txt``, but ``poetry`` is now the recommended way to interact with ``PyPortfolioOpt``

0.3.4
-----

Refactored shrinkage models, including single factor and constant correlation.



0.2.0
=====

- Hierarchical Risk Parity optimisation
- Semicovariance matrix
- Exponential covariance matrix
- CVaR optimisation
- Better support for custom objective functions
- Multiple bug fixes (including minimum volatility vs minimum variance)
- Refactored so all optimisers inherit from a ``BaseOptimizer``.

0.2.1
-----

- Included python 3.7 in travis build
- Merged PR from `schneiderfelipe <https://github.com/schneiderfelipe>`_ to fix error message.


0.1.0
=====

Initial release:

- Efficient frontier (max sharpe, min variance, target risk/return)
- L2 regularisation
- Discrete allocation
- Mean historical returns, exponential mean returns
- Sample covariance, sklearn wrappers.
- Tests
- Docs

0.1.1
-----

Minor bug fixes and documentation
